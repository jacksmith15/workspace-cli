## Why not [Bazel], [Buck], [Pants], or [Please]?

[Bazel](https://bazel.build/), [Buck](https://buck.build/), [Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) and [Please](https://please.build/) are all powerful build tools, with feature sets that overlap with Workspace. They give (usually) lightning-fast and reproducible builds, but dictate to some degree how projects should be structured.

In contrast, Workspace is _not_ a build tool. It has no opinions about how individual projects should be tested and built, or how the respective tooling for each project should be configured.

In a sense, Workspace lowers the barrier to entry for mono-repositories, by providing a lightweight abstraction layer around existing multi-repo processes rather than an entire build-system.
